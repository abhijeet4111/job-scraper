## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Update config.json

Open your `config.json` file and update the `sheet_id`:

```json
{
  "keywords": ["SAP", "Customer Success", "Data Analyst", "Consultant"],
  "location": "Pune",
  "sheet_id": "YOUR_ACTUAL_SHEET_ID_HERE",
  "sheet_name": "Jobs",
  "max_jobs_per_site": 50
}
```

Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_SHEET_ID_HERE` with the ID you copied from your Google Sheet URL.

## üß™ Test Your Setup

### Test Google Sheets Connection

1. **Run Test Command**:
```bash
cd sheets
python google_sheets.py
```

2. **Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Successfully authenticated with Google Sheets API
‚úÖ Connected to existing sheet: Jobs
üìä Sheet stats: {'total_jobs': 0}
‚úÖ Google Sheets connection test successful!
```

### Test Full Scraper

1. **Run Test Scraper**:
```bash
python jobs_runner.py --test
```

2. **Check Your Google Sheet**:
   - Should see headers automatically created
   - Should see a few test jobs added

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Credentials

1. **Never Commit credentials.json**
   - File is already in `.gitignore`
   - Double-check it's not in your git repository

2. **For GitHub Actions**
   - Don't put credentials in your code
   - Use GitHub Secrets (we'll set this up next)

3. **Local Development**
   - Keep `credentials.json` in project root
   - Don't share or email this file

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Authentication failed"
- ‚úÖ Check `credentials.json` is in project root
- ‚úÖ Verify file is valid JSON (not corrupted)
- ‚úÖ Ensure APIs are enabled in Google Cloud

#### "Permission denied"
- ‚úÖ Share sheet with service account email
- ‚úÖ Grant "Editor" permission (not just "Viewer")
- ‚úÖ Check service account has correct roles

#### "Sheet not found"
- ‚úÖ Verify sheet ID is correct
- ‚úÖ Check sheet name matches config
- ‚úÖ Ensure sheet is accessible

#### "Quota exceeded"
- ‚úÖ Google Sheets API has daily limits
- ‚úÖ Reduce `max_jobs_per_site` in config
- ‚úÖ Add delays between requests

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Error Messages**: Look for specific error details
2. **Verify Each Step**: Go through setup steps again
3. **Test Components**: Test Google Sheets connection separately
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure service account has access

## üìä What's Next?

After successful setup:

1. ‚úÖ **Test Local Scraping**: `python jobs_runner.py --test`
2. ‚úÖ **Configure Keywords**: Update your job search criteria
3. ‚úÖ **Set Up GitHub Actions**: For automated daily runs
4. ‚úÖ **Monitor Results**: Check your Google Sheet regularly
